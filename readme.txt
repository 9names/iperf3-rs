This is the most basic thing that could pass for an iperf3 server

It is incredibly primitive but it *does* work well enough to make iperf3 -c happy

I plan to make a better version of this, but I'm keeping this one as a quick reference for how iperf3 works since this was not clear to me, despite reading the docs and the code.
